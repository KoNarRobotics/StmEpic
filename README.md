# StmEpic library
This library is a collection of classes and functions that are used to interact with the STM32F4xx series of microcontrollers. The library is written in C++ and is designed to be used with the code generation tool STM32CubeMX.

## Features
- **GPIO**: The library provides a class that can be used to configure and control the GPIO pins on the microcontroller.
- **BOARD_ID**: The library provides a class that can be used to read the unique ID of the microcontroller from hex-encoder.
- **CAN_CONTROLLER**: The library provides a class that can be used to read and write data to the CAN.
- **Containers**: The library provides a set of containers that can be used to store data in a structured way.
- **Encoders**: The library provides a class that can be used to read data from I2C magnetic encoders.
- **Filters**: The library provides a set of filters that can be used to filter data.
- **Logger**: The library provides a class that can be used to log data to the console via USB with (debug,inwo,warning,and error).
- **Movement**: The library provides a class that can be used to control the movement of different type of engines (stepers for now).
- **Sensors**: The library provides a set of classes that can be used to read data from different sensors For now different types of 
Temperature sensors.
- **USB_PROGRAMING**: The library provides a class that can be used to enable the USB as programer using DFU.
